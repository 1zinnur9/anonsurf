how to use this repo
========

the anonsurf folder contains the sources of our deb package


the anonsurf deb package can be used to correctly install it on a debian/ubuntu system




there is also a bash script that can be used independently on any system with iptables and a tor transproxy
but not all the features of the packet are available
